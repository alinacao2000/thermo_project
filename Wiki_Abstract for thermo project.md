# Computational Simulations of Icosahedral Quasicrystals

## Overview
This project aims to investigate the computational self-assembly of Icosahedral Quasicrystals (IQCs) using molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we focus on two simulation systems, exploring how isotropic pair potentials contribute to the IQC's structure and phason flips dynamics.

## Background

Icosahedral Quasicrystals (IQCs) possess unique attributes like high symmetry and aperiodic long-range order. They have diverse applications ranging from photonic materials to specialized alloys. However, IQCs in non-atomic systems (like micellar or nanoparticle systems) are rare and typically do not exhibit icosahedral symmetry. Our work aims to fill this gap using computational simulations.

## Objectives

1. To study the self-assembly of IQCs using molecular dynamics simulations.
2. To understand how isotropic pair potentials contribute to the formation and dynamics of IQCs.

## Methodology

We will be implementing molecular dynamics simulations with effective pair potentials having three wells (3w-OPP). Our simulation will also focus on the presence and dynamics of phason flips within IQCs. The algorithms used will be optimized for computational efficiency and accuracy.

---

## Results and Discussion

The results will provide insights into the structure of IQCs and how different isotropic pair potentials affect them. We will evaluate our simulations based on the diffraction patterns and van Hove autocorrelation functions.

## Future Work

Further studies could extend the simulation to other types of quasicrystals or implement quantum mechanical interactions to compare with intermetallic systems.
